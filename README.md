#Romina's SVG

---

[Here is my SVG assignment](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~rk1824/dotw/svg/)

* I wanted this assignment to look like random paint drippings
* I drew it in Illustrator, and the original SVG file has completely different colors
* In the HTML file, I changed all of the colors of the SVG and added gradients
